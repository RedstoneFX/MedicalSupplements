--- Original Description ---
Overview
V1.1

Adds pharmaceuticals and new food items.

Drug Chemical Mixer

Autonomously produce precursor chemicals. The mixer has "input" and "output" hoppers to control resources and product. There is a selector for the chemical to produce, control production and set stock limits.

Drug Cabinet

Can be used to store items (acts as a shelf). Additionally adds some cleanliness whilst boosting production of drug labs.

Disinfectant Stand

A disinfectant stand that passively sterilises its surrounding. Adds cleanliness and a little beauty. Great for makeshift hospital, addition to food area or bathroom (if you are using dubs hygiene.)

Requires Medicine Production and Sterile materials research. Can link to beds to boost immunity gain by 0.03%. Cost 1 component, 40 silver, 4 medicine, and 40 material of choice.

Medical Mats

Bedrolls used in the field or as caravan itinerary. Four tech versions (Medieval, Industrial, Spacer and Ultra) which can be researched after hospital beds (except for Medieval which is after Carpet Making). Note the items are best made in advance at a tailoring bench/crafting spot. Upon deconstruction it will return the base item used and using a crafting spot you can repack any uninstalled buildings to be rolled back up. Suggest using the mod "Pick up and haul".

Precursor Chemicals

MS uses a number of additional precursors in the generation of the drugs. This is to add game play value and additional balancing elements for the use of the drugs. Details can be found in the Drug reference PDF below.

Drugs

Details of the drugs can now be found in the following PDF:

Immunisation

An immunisation injection can be made after Rimoxicillin research. Made from Ethyl mercury, Neutroamine and Rimoxicillin with the use of an industrial Med kit. The immunisation will either remove the “Sickly” trait from a colonist or will add the “Super-Immune” trait instead. It is provided in the form of a self-administered injection.

Cerebrax injection

Cerebrax is an injection that removes “negative” psychic sensitivity traits. Being spacer tech it is made with Ultratech medicine, Neutroamine, Lithium Salts and Clarity. The injection will remove psychic susceptibility traits in stages, so hyper-sensitivity will require two injections.


Additional Surgical procedures:

Medical Stent: Can be used to remove arterial blockages.

Artificial back discs: Can be used to remove the bad back condition.

Advanced Surgical tools: Can be used to perform complex surgeries where additional precision tools are required. Currently used in the following:

• Removal of Cataracts. (Combined with contact lenses).

Battle Stims

Battles Stims are short term Mechanite boosters akin to Luciferium, but the negative effects are different and more controlled in that there isn’t any lethality or addiction issues. Applied by self-administered injection prior to being drafted. The Stim lasts for half a day. (Further details in the PDF).

Transcendence

Transcendence is a stim that is similar to the Mechanoid Neurotrainer, it is an injection of treated mechanites that will effect the neural arrangements and chemistry of the brain. The effects of transcendence are less random with the capability of ordering the applied qualities of knowledge and skills learned into more characteristic skill sets. However the amount gained is slightly less than that of a normal Neurotrainer. (Further details in the PDF).


Mod Notes

Mod option to make bandage use more realistic.

Mod option to adjust the % base cost of research projects.

Includes bulk recipes as relevant. Includes bulk MS recipes for medicine and penoxy.

Also includes MS recipes for Ultratech Medicine, Healer mech serum and Ressurector mech serum as ultra tech. (Note that the Mech serums will need a number of Metasis vials to make).

Includes 3 different bandages at differing tech levels that act as a weaker counterpart to vanilla medicine but have advantages with weight, so ideal for caravan use or when medicine is limited.

Save compatible (Note: You will need to reassign new drug policies if part way through a savegame to schedule the use of the above MS drugs, see Drug Policy Fix below).

To remove the mod you would have to remove all the items introduced first.
